PHY571 Numerical Physics Project:  Bird Swarm

This Python code belongs to the PHY571 Numerical Physics Project. 
PHY571 is taught by Michel Ferrero and Arnaud Couairon at École Polytechnique de Paris.
The files are set up around a function which evolves  and calculates the dynamics of a swarm of interacting specified by the user (birds, cows, horses, fish, etc.).

Written by Pierre-Louis Wasmer (Physics PhD track), Fatemeh Nouri (Physics PhD track) and Alejandro van Breukelen García (M1 Physics) with assistance fom Michel Ferrero and Arnaud Couairon.
The code is written from scratch but the physics and algorithms used throughout it are based on the following sources:

-  T. Vicsek, A. Czirok, E. Ben-Jacob, I. Cohen, and O. Shochet, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, (1995) 1226. Novel Type of Phase Transition in a System of Self-Driven Particles.
