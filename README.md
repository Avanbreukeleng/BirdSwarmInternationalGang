PHY571 Numerical Physics Project:  Bird Swarm


This Python code was in November & December 2023 written in the context of the PHY571 Numerical Physics Course. 
PHY571 is taught by Michel Ferrero and Arnaud Couairon at École Polytechnique de Paris.
The files are set up around a function which computes the dynamics of a swarm of interacting entities specified by the user (birds, cows, horses, fish, etc.).

Written by Pierre-Louis Wasmer, Fatemeh Nouri and Alejandro van Breukelen García with assistance fom Michel Ferrero and Arnaud Couairon.
The code is written from scratch but the physics and algorithms used throughout it are based on the following sources:

-  T. Vicsek, A. Czirok, E. Ben-Jacob, I. Cohen, and O. Shochet, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, (1995) 1226. Novel Type of Phase Transition in a System of Self-Driven Particles.
  
-  Craig W. Reynolds, Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model, SIGGRAPH Comput. Graph., 21, (1987) 25-34.
  Institut Polytechnique de Paris
  
Some additional considerations:
Plotting functions and data analysis are contained within the Jupyter notebooks, while the main animation and production codes are left as .py files.
Please ensure that you download the New_output_files folder in order to run the Jupyter notebooks.
A report of our methods and results is included as a pdf file.


We hope you enjoy working with this program and if you have any remarks please do not hesitate to contact us.

NB: Please note that for the purpose of this project, the JetBrains code_with_me tool was used. This allowed the three authors to work simultaneously on the same code. Although the program was run on Alejandro van Breukelen's computer, and the first few commits on Github are shown to belong to him only, all authors contributed equally.
