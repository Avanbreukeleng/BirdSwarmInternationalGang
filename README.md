PHY571 Numerical Physics Project:  Bird Swarm

This Python code belongs to the PHY571 Numerical Physics Project. 
PHY571 is taught by Michel Ferrero and Arnaud Couairon at École Polytechnique de Paris.
The files are set up around a function which evolves  and calculates the dynamics of a swarm of interacting specified by the user (birds, cows, horses, fish, etc.).

Written by Pierre-Louis Wasmer, Fatemeh Nouri and Alejandro van Breukelen García with assistance fom Michel Ferrero and Arnaud Couairon.
The code is written from scratch but the physics and algorithms used throughout it are based on the following sources:

-  T. Vicsek, A. Czirok, E. Ben-Jacob, I. Cohen, and O. Shochet, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, (1995) 1226. Novel Type of Phase Transition in a System of Self-Driven Particles.

We hope you enjoy working with this program and if you have any remarks please do not hesitate to contact us.

NB: Please note that for the purpose of this project, JetBrains code_with_me tool was used. This allowed the three authors to work simultaneously on the same code. Although the program was run on Alejandro van Breukelen's computer, and the commits on Github are shown to belong to him only, all authors contributed equally.
